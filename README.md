# Das-term

This is an emulated terminal that I built with React.

The utlities have been created by using Javascript and replicates an interactive terminal. The entire development has been done on a Mac.

Just make sure you have npm, node and react with expo installed on your system before you proceed.

To run the porgram locally,
1. Clone the repo onto your local machine. 
2. use "npm -i" or "yarn-install" 
3. cd terminal-portfolio 
4. yarn start
